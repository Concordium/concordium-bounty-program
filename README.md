The Concordium Bounty Program is here. This inaugural program aims to foster a deeper mutual understanding and build a robust developer ecosystem for Concordiumâ€™s expanding use case pipeline.

Concordium, a public permissionless layer-1 with a built-in ID-layer, provides a versatile platform for developers to tackle diverse business segments and use cases. Concordium is on the lookout for talented freelancer developers, professional developer houses, and coders eager to master Concordium's intricacies.

Participating in this bounty program gives you the chance to showcase and validate your skills, potentially joining our list of verified developers for various use cases. Each bounty comes with a reward, serving as an invitation to demonstrate your capabilities. Exceptional performance could lead to further opportunities.

The program aims to attract developers capable of creating robust, reliable, state-of-the-art applications. Beyond earning rewards, youâ€™ll have the opportunity to validate your skills and get hired by Concordiumâ€™s clients.

Your feedback is crucial and will be welcomed throughout the program to continually improve and evolve Concordium.

Stay tuned for more tasks!
