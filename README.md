Fellow Concordians, we are delighted to announce the Concordium Bounty Program. 


This is the first iteration of the program which we expect will help us and you to understand each other better and build a great developer ecosystem to support Concordiumâ€™s fast-growing use case pipeline. 


Concordium is a public permissionless layer-1 that offers developers the platform to work across all business segments and use cases.   


We are seeking freelancer developers, professional developer houses, and coders who we should come to know Concordium inside out! By participating in this bounty program you have an opportunity to show and validate your skills so we can add you to our list of verified developers we offer out to use cases. 


Each bounty offers a reward, but that is only the beginning, an invitation if you like. We would expect to offer more opportunities to those who show us their capabilities and excellence.  


We expect these developer activities to attract new developers who will implement robust, reliable, state-of-the-art applications. The program will not only allow you to make money but also validate your skills to get hired by Concordiumâ€™s clients.  


Feedback will be provided during the program; your input is always welcome and will help us improve and evolve.
 
Stay tuned for more tasks!
